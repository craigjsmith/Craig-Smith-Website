                                <p>GENISAMA, a startup artificial intelligence company spun off from Michigan State University research, needed a solution to distribute software to their customers. This distribution needed to be authenticated, meaning only available to customers with a valid serial code. Using modern web technologies like Amazon Web Services, I built a web application that allows for this.</p>

                                <p>First, a user creates an account. Along with their registration, they provide a serial number. Using Lambda and DynamoDB, these serial numbers can be verified and assigned uniquely to a user. Before the serial numbers are checked, the invisible reCAPTCHA v3 must be satisfied. This prevents spam, or bot attempts to guess a valid serial number. After registration, the user is prompted to verify their account with a confirmation code sent to their email through SES. This allows the user to reset their password if needed. Once their account registration has been completed, the user is able to download their licensed software. Every file download is provisioned through Cognito and IAM, so the resulting download link is only valid for the provisioned user, and only temporarily.</p>

                                <p>With my software, GENISAMA can securely distribute their proprietary software exclusively to licensed customers. Built with modern web and AWS technologies, my solution is scalable, cost effective, and reliable.</p>
                                
                                <p>After the completion of this project, I was contracted again to implement the Cognito authenticaion scheme from this application into an already existing Android app. This integration was simple using AWS SDK and reCAPTCHA SDK for Android, nearly identical to its implementation in Javascript.</p>
