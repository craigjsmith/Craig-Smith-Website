<p>Java was the first programming language I learned, experimenting with it while still in middle school and learning it thoroughly while in high school. I love it for its strong enforcement of object-oriented principles, which I think forces developers to create better designed software. Iâ€™ve used Java in Android development, including my FIRST robotics scouting app and in implementing AWS Cognito authentication in an app for GENISAMA. Additionally, I used it in developing software for our robot in FIRST robotics and extensively in my coursework (at Hope College, where I dual enrolled while in high school).</p>
