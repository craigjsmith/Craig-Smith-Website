<p>Iâ€™ve worked with JavaScript to create web applications, including an application I was contracted to create for GENISAMA that allowed for software distribution and user account management."</p>
  
<p>Additionally, I've created 'I Listen To', a web application to show personalized Spotify listening statistics using React JS and the Spotify API. I have also used JavaScript in my coursework and to enhance websites, such as this one.</p>

<p>I've also used Node.js to create Javascript backends. Working for the Institute for Health Policy at Michigan State University, I built a prototype web app for the West MI Return to Work effort that automates the submission and processing of COVID-19 screening data</p>
