<p>Iâ€™ve worked with JavaScript to create web applications, including an application I created for GENISAMA for software distribution and user account management which I integrated using AWS Cognito using the AWS Amplify library. Additionally, I created ilistento.net, a web application to show personalized Spotify listening statistics that I built using React JS and Spotify API. I have also used JavaScript in my coursework and to enhance websites, such as this one.</p>

<p>I've also used Node.js to create Javascript backends. Working for the Institute for Health Policy at Michigan State University, I built a prototype web app for the West MI Return to Work effort the that automates the submission and processing of COVID-19 screening data</p>
